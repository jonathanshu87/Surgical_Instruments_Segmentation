# Surgical_Instruments_Segmentation
This repository is the implementation of the paper [Real-Time Instrument Segmentation in Robotic Surgery Using Auxiliary Supervised Deep Adversarial Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8648150)
[MICCAI Surgical Instrument Segmentation Challenge 2017](https://endovissub2017-roboticinstrumentsegmentation.grand-challenge.org/)
MICCAI 2017 Surgical Instrument Segmentation Challenge dataset is used to conduct all the experiments in this paper. The dataset is split into train and validation set as: \n
Train Set: 1,2,3,4,5,6
Validation Set: 7,8
